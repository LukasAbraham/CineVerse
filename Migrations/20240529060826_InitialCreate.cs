With a career beginning in childhood, he has proven both his longevity and his ability to transition from celebrated child actor to adult performer with a diverse range of roles across genres and mediums.\n\nWood's early filmography demonstrates his youthful promise. Films like 'Paradise' (1991), 'Radio Flyer' (1992), and the psychological thriller 'The Good Son' (1993) established him as a talented presence. Though starring in 'North' (1994) proved a critical misstep, his performance was often singled out as a bright spot. His exploration of more mature roles in 'The Ice Storm' (1997), 'Deep Impact' (1998), and 'The Faculty' (1998) showcased a growing versatility as Wood gracefully navigated the transition to young adult.\n\nThe 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001-2003) transformed him into a global star. His heartfelt portrayal of Frodo Baggins, the humble hobbit burdened with the extraordinary task of destroying the One Ring, earned him widespread acclaim. Rather than remaining typecast following this success, Wood actively pursued challenging, offbeat roles that showcased his depth. He delivered a chilling performance as the sociopathic Kevin in 'Sin City' (2005) and lent his voice to both animation ('Happy Feet,' '9') and quirky television projects ('American Dad!,' 'Robot Chicken').\n\nBalancing both mainstream and independent cinema, Wood starred as a tormented writer in 'Maniac' (2012) while also reprising his role as Frodo Baggins in 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (2012). He played the lead role in the BBC America series 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency' (2016-2017), where his portrayal of the endearingly eccentric Todd Brotzman brought him further recognition.\n\nAn avid music lover, Wood demonstrates his entrepreneurial side as the founder of the record label Simian Records. His interest in the production side of the entertainment industry led to the creation of the production company SpectreVision in 2010. Specializing in horror and genre films, SpectreVision has backed titles like 'Cooties' (2014), 'A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' (2014), and the acclaimed 'Mandy' (2018).\n\nIn recent years, Wood has continued his eclectic filmography with parts in films like 'Come to Daddy' (2019), 'I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore' (2017), and 'Color Out of Space' (2019). He also voiced characters in the video games 'Broken Age' (2014) and '11-11: Memories Retold' (2018).

Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.\n\nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.

                    { 2636, "Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980), was an English director and producer. Labeled as the \"Master of Suspense\", he became known for thrillers, often combined with a dark sense of humor. After a successful career in his native country, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939. Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside icy blonde female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys —or MacGuffins— meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1965), he became a cultural icon.\n\nHitchcock is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema. In 2002, Hitchcock was ranked 2nd behind Orson Welles in the critics' top ten poll in the list of The Greatest Directors of All Time compiled by the Sight & Sound magazine. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968 included him in the \"pantheon\" of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States.\n\nHitchcock's critically most acclaimed film is the psychological thriller film Vertigo (1958). Although being a mild failure upon its release, it has risen in popularity over the decades. In 2012 it even replaced Orson Welles' Citizen Kane as the greatest film ever made in the Sight & Sound critics' poll. Regarding visual style, Vertigo is often declared as Hitchcock's most perfect film.

Considered one of the most influential actors of the 20th century, he received numerous accolades throughout his career which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three British Academy Film Awards. Brando was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.\n\nHe initially gained acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and a first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James A. Michener's 1954 novel.\n\nThe 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972). He got the part and subsequently won his second Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He declined the Academy Award due to alleged mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972), Brando reestablished himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in supporting roles, such as Jor-El in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and Adam Steiffel in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.\n\nBrando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950.

He is considered the \"father of method acting in America,\" according to author Mel Gussow, and from the 1920s until his death in 1982 \"he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies\".  From his base in New York, he trained several generations of theatre and film's most illustrious talents, including Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and director Elia Kazan.  Former student Elia Kazan directed James Dean in East of Eden (1955), for which Kazan and Dean were nominated for Academy Awards. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was \"the greatest school of the theater [and] the best thing that can happen to an actor\".  Playwright Tennessee Williams, writer of A Streetcar Named Desire, said of Strasberg's actors, \"They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life.\" Directors like Sidney Lumet, a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg's \"Method\".  Kazan, in his autobiography, wrote, \"He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home.... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them 'permanent.'\"  :61 Today, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel lead this nonprofit studio dedicated to the development of actors, playwrights, and directors.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Lee Strasberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", new DateTime(1901, 9, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(1982, 2, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, "nm0833448", "Acting", "Lee Strasberg", new List<string>(), "Budzanów, Austria-Hungary", 4.2949999999999999, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\niSM7ejzddgaTcxjgJMYEFCr9Y2.jpg" },

Hatchet-faced with piercing eyes, he had declined to have his nose altered to play a sympathetic character in his film debut, High Noon, and was relegated to a non-speaking outlaw as a result. For a decade he was typecast as a minor villain, his sinister features overshadowing his acting skills. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef began to lose interest in his apparently waning career by the time Sergio Leone gave him a major role in For a Few Dollars More. The film made him a box-office draw, especially in Europe.\n\nMilitary service:\n\nAfter basic training and further training at the Naval Fleet Sound School, Van Cleef was assigned to a submarine chaser and then to a minesweeper, USS Incredible, on which he worked as a sonarman.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, Van Cleef read for a part in Our Town at the Little Theater Group in Clinton, New Jersey and received his first stage role. From there, he continued to meet with the group and audition for parts. The next biggest part was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play Heaven Can Wait. During this time, he was observed by visiting talent scouts, who were impressed by Van Cleef's stage presence and delivery. One of these scouts later took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the MCA agency, who then sent him to the Alvin Theater for an audition.\n\nVan Cleef's screen debut came in High Noon. During a performance of Mister Roberts in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film director Stanley Kramer, who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film. Kramer originally wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but as he wanted Van Cleef to have his \"distinctive nose\" fixed, Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was then cast mostly in villainous roles, due to his sharp cheeks and chin, piercing eyes, and hawk-like nose, from the part of Tony Romano in Kansas City Confidential (1952), culminating 14 years later in Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nDespite suffering from heart disease from the late 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the early 1980s, Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989, at age 64. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California, with an inscription on his grave marker referring to his many acting performances as a villain: \"BEST OF THE BAD\".

Among his films in English, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), both directed by Sergio Leone, are perhaps the best known.\n\nBorn in Rome as Giovanni Baragli, he was introduced in the film industry by his uncle, the renowned editor Eraldo Da Roma. He started his career in 1944 as film operator and assistant editor for Marinai senza stelle by Francesco De Robertis.\n\nDuring his career he worked as editor in more than 200 productions between 1944 and 1996, including works by Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Sergio Leone, Damiano Damiani, Luigi Zampa, Giuliano Montaldo, Sergio Corbucci, Mauro Bolognini, Luigi Comencini, Cristina Comencini, Florestano Vancini, Gabriele Salvatores, Alberto Lattuada, Tinto Brass, Margarethe von Trotta, Pál Sándor, Bernardo Bertolucci, Roberto Benigni, Massimo Troisi.  The single largest impact of Baragli's editing is likely on the films of Pier Paolo Pasolini. Gino Moliterno as described Pasolini as follows: \"Outside Italy Pasolini is usually remembered as one of the most significant of the directors who emerged in the second wave of Italian postwar cinema in the early 1960s but, within Italy itself, Pasolini was always much more than just a distinctive and innovative filmmaker. By the time he came to make his first film, Accattone, in 1961, he had already published numerous collections of poetry, two highly-acclaimed novels, had collaborated widely in cultural-literary journals and firmly established himself as one of Italy’s leading writer-intellectuals.\"\n\nStefano Musi has called Baragli's contributions to Pasolini's films \"enormous\"; Baragli edited every one of Pasolini's feature films from his first, Accattone (1961), to his final film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975), which was released shortly after his murder. Geoffrey Nowell-Smith has written of the editing innovations in their early films, \"When Accatone and Mamma Roma came out, Pasolini and his editor Nino Baragli were widely condemned as amateurish and incompetent, which is rather like saying that Cezanne's brushstrokes showed that he couldn't paint.\" Perhaps the best-known of Pasolini's films to English-speaking audiences is The Gospel According to Saint Matthew (1964), now considered a masterpiece by many critics. Nowell-Smith writes of the editing that \"large sections of the film do not even bother to respect continuity, let alone to pay obeisance to it. ... Each shot simply presents itself as reality in its own right but there is no attempt to maintain the realistic illusion that had been the foundation of cinema since the early 1920s if not before.\" ...\n\nSource: Article \"Nino Baragli\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.", new DateTime(1925, 10, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(2013, 5, 29, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, "nm0052849", "Editing", "Nino Baragli", new List<string> { "Nino Barragli", "Giovanni Baragli" }, "Rome, Lazio, Italy", 8.8510000000000009, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\2iWNZkKmuo17q4QCI8TMhGPD7PA.jpg" },

His early career peaked with his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, about an Oklahoma family who moved to California during the Dust Bowl 1930s. This film is widely considered to be among the greatest American films.\n\nIn 1941 he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck in the screwball comedy classic The Lady Eve. Book-ending his service in WWII were his starring roles in two highly regarded westerns: The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and My Darling Clementine (1946), the latter directed by John Ford, and he also starred in Ford's western Fort Apache (1948). After a seven-year break from films, during which Fonda focused on stage productions, he returned with the WWII war-boat ensemble Mister Roberts (1955). In 1957 he starred as Juror No.8, the hold-out juror, in 12 Angry Men. Fonda, who was also co-producer, won the BAFTA for Best Foreign Actor.\n\nLater in his career, Fonda moved into darker roles, such as the villain in the epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), underrated and a box office disappointment at its time of release, but now regarded as one of the best westerns of all time. He also played in lighter-hearted fare such as Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball, but also often played important military figures, such as a Colonel in Battle of the Bulge (1965), and Admiral Nimitz in Midway (1976). He finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards for his final film role in On Golden Pond (1981), which also starred Katharine Hepburn and his daughter Jane Fonda, but was too ill to attend the ceremony. He died from heart disease a few months later.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Henry Fonda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", new DateTime(1905, 5, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(1982, 8, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, "http://www.henry-fonda.com/", "nm0000020", "Acting", "Henry Fonda", new List<string> { "Hank Fonda", "Henry Jaynes Fonda", "One-Take Fonda", "Генри Фонда" }, "Grand Island, Nebraska, USA", 24.962, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\6wXWsqSXF3wCsGcwVqiszy6RX9X.jpg" },

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production.\n\nKurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another fifteen films.\n\nRashomon (1950), which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), Yojimbo (1961) and High and Low (1963). After the 1960s he became much less prolific; even so, his later work—including two of his final films, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to receive great acclaim.\n\nIn 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Akira Kurosawa , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", new DateTime(1910, 3, 23, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(1998, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, "nm0000041", "Directing", "Akira Kurosawa", new List<string> { "黒澤明", "أكيرا كوروساوا", "อะกิระ คุโระซะวะ", "Акира Куросава", "黑澤明", "구로사와 아키라", "אקירה קורוסאווה", "Kurosawa Akira", "黑泽明", "아키라 구로사와", "쿠로사와 아키라", "아키라 쿠로사와" }, "Shinagawa, Tokyo Prefecture, Japan", 21.085000000000001, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\eGexa6MZ22T1MZxce1qR3RcAYaS.jpg" },

He also played the role of Willy Loman in the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan. On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series The Virginian. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges.

Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the blacklist, he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA. Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC \"friendly witnesses\", on the 1954 film On the Waterfront, which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.  His 1968 performance as King Lear achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.  One of his final film roles was that of police detective Lt.

Several years later, he began his acting career by performing in school plays, before moving to Australia for his high school senior year. He left high school without graduating, but earned a diploma through a professional education course, and graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in film. For much of the mid-1990s, he lived in New York City as a struggling, unemployed actor.\n\nAs an undergraduate at BYU, Eckhart met director and writer Neil LaBute, who cast him in several of his own original plays. Five years later Eckhart made a debut as an unctuous, sociopathic ladies' man in LaBute's black comedy film In the Company of Men (1997). Under LaBute's guidance he worked in the director's films Your Friends & Neighbors (1998), Nurse Betty (2000), and Possession (2002).\n\nEckhart gained wide recognition as George in Steven Soderbergh's critically acclaimed film Erin Brockovich (2000), and, in 2006, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Nick Naylor in Thank You for Smoking. He gained further mainstream breakout in 2008 when he starred in the blockbuster Batman film The Dark Knight as District Attorney Harvey Dent / Two-Face.

When Sam was five years old, his parents separated, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York.\n\nHe made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film Clownhouse (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO's Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy Award-winning episode of Law & Order (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays.\n\nHis performances in The Green Mile (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999) wowed audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter.\n\nMore recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies.

He many times remarked that he had \"the heart of a little boy\", quipping \"I keep it in a jar on my desk.\"\n\nBloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over twenty novels, usually crime fiction, science fiction and, perhaps most influentially, horror fiction (Psycho). He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle. H. P. Lovecraft was Bloch's mentor and one of the first to seriously encourage his talent.\n\nBloch was a contributor to pulp magazines such as Weird Tales in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to science fiction fanzines and fandom in general.\n\nHe was the recipient of the Hugo Award (for his story \"That Hell-Bound Train\"), the Bram Stoker Award, and the World Fantasy Award.

In 1998, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score for Roberto Benigni's film Life Is Beautiful (1997).\n\nAfter high school, Piovani enrolled at the Sapienza University of Rome, receiving his degree in piano from the Verdi Conservatory in Milan in 1967, and later studied orchestration under the Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis.\n\nIn 1971 and 1973 collaborated for the music of two albums of the songwriter Fabrizio De André: Storia di un impiegato and Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo. In 2008, after De André departure, Piovani wrote the music for the film Amore che vieni, amore che vai, inspired by a novel of De André himself, Un destino ridicolo.\n\nAmong his more popular works is the score for the Federico Fellini film Intervista, his second of three collaborations with the famous director, the others being Ginger e Fred (Ginger and Fred in English) and La voce della luna (The Voice of the Moon). Years later, he composed a ballet titled Balletto Fellini.\n\nIn 2000, his Academy Award-winning score for Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella) was further nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\" category, losing to Randy Newman. In 2005, he was a member of the jury at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. In light of his recent work with French directors, notably Danièle Thompson, Philippe Lioret, and Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt, the French Minister of Culture gave him the title of Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres on 21 May 2008 at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTo date, Piovani has over 130 film scores to his credit, including films such as Slap the Monster on Page One (1972), The Perfume of the Lady in Black (1974), Flavia the Heretic (1974), Le Orme (1975), A Leap in the Dark (1980) The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982), and Kaos (1984). The music for the latter is considered by many as one of the best film scores ever done. However, he is reported to believe that \"Too many film scores make a composer a hack, but in the theatre music is above all craftsmanship\". Accordingly, he continues to work in musical theatre, and also composes concert and chamber music.\n\nPiovani also composed the first opera Amorosa presenza on a libretto by Aisha Cerami and Nicola Piovani, based on the novel by Vincenzo Cerami and is performed at the Teatro Verdi in Trieste in January 2022.\n\nIn 2023, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Soundtrack Academy.\n\nIn 2024, Piovani composed the score for Loris Lai's debut feature film, How Kids Roll.\n\nSource: Article \"Nicola Piovani\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.", new DateTime(1946, 5, 26, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), null, 2, null, "nm0003607", "Sound", "Nicola Piovani", new List<string> { "Nikola Piovani" }, "Rome, Italy", 5.3680000000000003, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\56tRfEIn4RBPhjJ7JOGCOtTZApU.jpg" },

His mother Filomena Spagnuolo (b. 1903, d. 1987) was a bit-part actress who acted in a few movies, some of them alongside her son. Spinell stood 5 foot and 11 inches. He was born at his family's apartment in Manhattan's Little Italy on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. A few years after the death of his father, he moved with his mother and older siblings to Woodside, Queens, New York where he lived off-and-on for the remainder of his life. Spinell suffered most of his life from hemophilia as well as chronic asthma. Because of his large, heavyset frame and imposing looks, Spinell was often cast as criminals, thugs, or corrupt police officers. His most notable roles were as mafioso Willi Cicci in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, and as loan shark Tony Gazzo in Rocky and Rocky II. Although primarily known as a character actor, Spinell co-wrote and starred as a serial killer in the 1980 film, Maniac. Joe Spinell died in his apartment on January 13, 1989 at the age of 52. The cause of his untimely death is arguable to this day. Some say that his death was caused by sudden heart attack due to heavy drug use, drinking and emotional distress in light of his mother passing away two years earlier. It is also speculated that he may have died from asthma complications, or bled to death from hemophilia related causes. He was planning a sequel to Maniac before his death. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens near his home. He is the distant cousin of the American football team St. Louis Ram's Head Coach Steve Spagnuolo.

Her most enduring impact was as one of network radio's most versatile actresses. Often appearing in 15 shows a week, comedies, dramas, thrillers, soap operas, and crime dramas, and she became known as the First Lady of Radio.\n\nHeaven Only Knows (1947) was her first film. She went on to roles in other films such as Orson Welles's Macbeth (1948), Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948) and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), as the wife of Sheriff Chambers. In Don't Bother to Knock (1952) she portrayed a mother who lets a disturbed Marilyn Monroe babysit her daughter. The next year she appeared again with Marilyn in Niagara, as Mrs. Kettering. She had a rare starring role in Ma Barker's Killer Brood (1960). She played Grandma Pusser in the original Walking Tall film trilogy, and also appeared in horror films such as The Manitou (1978), starring Tony Curtis. Her final film role was in the 1983 film Testament.  Tuttle became a familiar face to millions of television viewers with more than 100 appearances from 1950 to 1986, often in the role of an inquisitive busybody. On television and in films, Tuttle streamlined herself into a pattern of roles between wise, loving wives/mothers or bristling matrons. She was familiar to the early television audience as wife/mother Lavinia (Vinnie) Day in Life with Father (1953–1955).

In 1975 she wrote a book of poetry, Canto rituale (Ritual Song).\n\nThroughout her 25-year career she covered the richly diverse genres of traditional music of her native Sardinia (Cantu a chiterra, ninne nanne—children's lullabies, gosos, Gregorian chants, and more), often updating them with a modern and personal touch. She succeeded in bringing Sardinian folk music into wider popular awareness in demonstrations at a national level in Italy (like the Canzonissima in 1974) as well as internationally (especially in France and the United States).\n\nMaria Carta won the Miss Sardinia beauty contest in 1957 and later participated in the national Miss Italy competition.\n\nAround 1960, she moved to Rome where she met the screenwriter Salvatore Laurani whom she later married. She attended the Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare, directed by Diego Carpitella, at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia and at the same time she pursued a musical and ethnographic research path with important productions and collaborations.\n\nIn 1971, she made two albums: Sardegna canta and Paradiso in re, and in the meantime she attended the ethnomusicologist Gavino Gabriel. The same year RAI broadcast the television documentary Incontro con Maria Carta (photography by Franco Pinna and texts by Velia Magno), in which she sang and recited with Riccardo Cucciolla.\n\nIn 1972, she played at the Teatro Argentina in Rome in the Medea by Franco Enriquez. The same year she met Amália Rodrigues, with whom she held a concert at the Teatro Sistina. In 1973, the two artists made a tour in Sardinia.\n\nIn 1974, she participated in Canzonissima, interpreting the traditional Sardinian Ave Maria Deus ti salvet Maria. She reached the final and was ranked second in the group of folk music with the song Amore disisperadu. In 1975, she held an important concert at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. In 1976, she served as Communal Councilwoman for the Italian Communist Party, in the city council of Rome and remained in office until 1981.\n\nIn 1980, she participated in the Festival d'Avignon; in 1987 she performed in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City; and in 1988 in St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.\n\nShe caught the attention of such directors as Francis Ford Coppola – who gave her the first of two of her widely-seen film roles as the mother of Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II (1974) – and Franco Zeffirelli, who cast her as Martha, the sister of Lazarus, in Jesus of Nazareth (1977).\n\nIn 1985, she was awarded, as songwriter, the Targo Tenco for dialectal/regional music.\n\nIn the last years of her life, Carta gave her time to the University of Bologna where she conducted a series of classes and advised student theses on which she had relevant personal, human experience and scholarly background.\n\nIn 1991, the President of Italy, Francesco Cossiga, named her a \"Commendatore della Repubblica\" (\"Knight of the Republic\"), similar to the British CBE.\n\nSource: Article \"Maria Carta\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.", new DateTime(1934, 6, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(1994, 9, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 1, null, "nm0141404", "Acting", "Maria Carta", new List<string>(), "Siligo, Sardinia, Italy", 3.6629999999999998, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\ifWc3ofLuTWwnC3oMcBU5ceUBFp.jpg" },

His work ranged from composing music for frequent Spaghetti Westerns such as Johnny Oro to being the musical director and conductor in Federico Fellini's Orchestra Rehearsal.\n\nIn 1985 he won the David di Donatello Best Music award for the film score of Pizza Connection.\n\nCarlo Savina came from a musical family—his father was the first clarinet for the orchestra of Italian public radio broadcaster EIAR. Carlo learned the violin as a child and went on to graduate from the Conservatory of Music Giuseppe Verdi in Turin where he studied piano, violin, composition, and conducting. In 1945 he began composing music for radio. Early in his career he was awarded a prize by the Accademia Musicale Chigiana. He started his own orchestra and soon was famous.

His television series Mozart in the Jungle won the 2016 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. In 2019, Coppola was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nCoppola serves as president of the San Francisco-based film company American Zoetrope. He is also the founder and owner of The Directors Bureau, a commercial and music video production company.  Coppola began his directing career by overseeing in-camera visual effects and second unit direction for Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which garnered a BAFTA Award nomination for Visual Effects. He has continued to do second unit direction throughout his career, including his father's Jack, The Rainmaker, Youth Without Youth, and Tetro; collaborator Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited; and his sister Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette.\n\nIn the 1990s, Coppola established himself as an influential music video and commercial director. Through his production company, The Directors Bureau, he directed all four music videos for The Strokes' 2001 debut album, Is This It, as well as \"12:51\" for Room on Fire. His other music videos include clips for Daft Punk, Lilys, Moby, The Presidents of the United States of America, Ween, Green Day, and Fatboy Slim.

He has also been a supporter of cousin Jason Schwartzman's musical side project, Coconut Records.\n\nHis first feature film, CQ, premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and was well-received critically. Set in Paris in 1969, CQ centers on a young film editor trying to juggle his personal and professional life while simultaneously juggling a science fiction adventure and his own personal art film.

He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for 10, winning 4.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his \"strong direction of actors\", \"vigorous storytelling\" and the \"social realism\" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been \"one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.\" Lumet was also known as an \"actor's director,\" having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than \"any other director.\"\n\nLumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his \"brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture.\" Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sidney Lumet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​", new DateTime(1924, 6, 25, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(2011, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, "nm0001486", "Directing", "Sidney Lumet", new List<string> { "西德尼·吕美特", "Сидни Люмет" }, "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA", 15.109, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\hjj3V2DkPJ46zo5uz9bsZQzAk6R.jpg" },

He was a popular sex symbol in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nHis father was Merle Johnson, the manager of the motion-picture department of General Motors. His mother, Edith Johnson, was a retired stage actress. Donahue attended a New York military academy, where he met Francis Ford Coppola. When Donahue was 18, he moved to New York and got a job as a messenger in a film company founded by his father. He was fired, he says, because he was too young to join the union. He attended Columbia University and studied journalism. He trained briefly with Ezra Stone, and then moved to Hollywood.\n\nThe big break of Donahue's career came when he was cast opposite Sandra Dee in A Summer Place, made by Warner Bros. in 1959. The director was Delmer Daves. Warner signed him to a long-term contract. They put him to work guest-starring in episodes of their Western TV series, such as Colt .45 (1959), Maverick (1959), Sugarfoot (1959), The Alaskans (1960), and Lawman (1960).\n\nIn 1968, Donahue signed a long-term contract with Universal Studios for films and TV. This lasted a year and saw him get four roles: guest shots on Ironside (1968), The Name of the Game (1968), and The Virginian (1969), and an appearance in the TV movie The Lonely Profession (1969).\n\nDonahue declared bankruptcy in 1968 and eventually lost his home. In 1969, Donahue moved from Los Angeles to New York City. By this time, Donahue's drug addiction and alcoholism had ruined him financially. In May 1982, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous, which he credited for helping him achieve and maintain sobriety.\n\nDonahue continued to act in films throughout the 1980s and into the late 1990s. Donahue's final film role was in the 2000 comedy film The Boys Behind the Desk, directed by Sally Kirkland.\n\nOn August 30, 2001, Donahue suffered a heart attack and was admitted to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica.

Houghton had graduated from UCLA with majors in English and economics. He was at that time known as 'Arch'. The origin of his nickname 'Buck' may have been the result of buck teeth as a child. His career began in Hollywood as back stage help on films by Cecil B. DeMille, then as reader for Val Lewton and story editor to David O. Selznick. Via subsequent stints at Paramount's casting and budget departments, the Office of War Information (where he worked on short propaganda films) and four years as executive assistant at RKO, Houghton worked his way up to television producer by the early 1950's. He served as associate producer on an excellent early action series, Yancy Derringer (1958), which is, sadly, almost forgotten today. William Self, who preferred to remain in his executive position with CBS, offered Houghton the job of producing \"The Twilight Zone\" and Houghton enthusiastically accepted, having perused the first two scripts. He became popular with many of the directors, for example Douglas Heyes (usually put in charge of more character-driven assignments like \"The Invaders\"), who regarded him as the best producer he ever worked with. Most importantly, Houghton complemented the creative genius of Rod Serling by his expertise in all minutiae of production.\n\nHoughton left \"Twilight Zone\" at the end of season three, having raised objections about extending the show to the -- as it turned out, much less suitable -- one-hour format. Few of his subsequent appointments proved entirely satisfactory: Houghton more often found his style cramped, clashing with stars he regarded as 'autocratic' (The Richard Boone Show (1963), Hawaii Five-O (1968)) or executive producers he disliked (Lost in Space (1965)).

He had supporting roles in films such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Psycho (1960).  Albertson made well over 100 appearances (1923–1964) in movies and television. In his early career he often sang and danced in such films as Just Imagine (1930) and A Connecticut Yankee (1931). He was featured in Alice Adams (1935) as the title character's brother, and in Room Service (1938) he played opposite the Marx Brothers. He served in the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit making training films during World War II. As he aged he moved from featured roles to supporting and character parts—in his later career he can be seen as Sam Wainwright, the businessman fond of saying \"Hee-Haw\" in the movie It's a Wonderful Life (1946).\n\nAlbertson portrayed future U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in the 1956 episode \"Rough Rider\" of the CBS western television series My Friend Flicka. He guest starred in the early NBC western series The Californians and twice in the David Janssen crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective.\n\nHe was cast in 1959 and 1962 in different roles on Walter Brennan's sitcom The Real McCoys. In 1960, he appeared as General Devery in the episode \"Strange Encounter\" of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series Colt .45.\n\nIn 1960, he played the wealthy rancher Tom Cassidy at the beginning of Psycho (1960) who provides the $40,000 in cash that Janet Leigh's character later steals. In the 1960-61 television season, he played the character Mr. Cooper in five episodes of the CBS sitcom Bringing Up Buddy, starring Frank Aletter. In 1964, Albertson was cast as Jim O'Neal in the episode \"The Death of a Teacher\" of the NBC education drama Mr. Novak. One of his final screen appearances was as \"Sam,\" the bewildered mayor of Sweet Apple, Ohio, in the 1963 film musical Bye Bye Birdie.\n\nHis last appearance was on The Andy Griffith Show, in which he played a Marine commander completing an inspection.

Many of Corman's films are based on works that have an already-established critical reputation, such as his cycle of low-budget cult films adapted from the tales of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nIn 1964, Corman—admired by members of the French New Wave and Cahiers du Cinéma—became the youngest filmmaker to have a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, as well as in the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art. He was the co-founder of New World Pictures, the founder of New Concorde and is a longtime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award \"for his rich engendering of films and filmmakers\".\n\nCorman mentored and gave a start to many young film directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante, John Sayles, and James Cameron, and was highly influential in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He also helped to launch the careers of actors like Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, Sylvester Stallone, Diane Ladd, and William Shatner. Corman has occasionally taken minor acting roles in the films of directors who started with him, including The Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather Part II, Apollo 13, The Manchurian Candidate, and Philadelphia.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Roger Corman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", new DateTime(1926, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(2024, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, "nm0000339", "Production", "Roger Corman", new List<string> { "Roger William Corman", "The Pope of Pop Cinema" }, "Detroit, Michigan, USA", 17.382000000000001, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\kWvtdBp4AVSOwluWwZ1WhsKlAfk.jpg" },

Perlman has performed worldwide, and throughout the United States, in venues that have included a State Dinner at the White House honoring Queen Elizabeth II, and at President Barack Obama's inauguration. He has conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Westchester Philharmonic. In 2015, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He has received 16 Grammy Awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and four Emmy Awards.\n\nPerlman was born in 1945 in Tel Aviv. His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were Jewish natives of Poland and had independently emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) in the mid-1930s before they met and later married. Perlman contracted polio at age four and has walked using leg braces and crutches since then and plays the violin while seated. As of 2018, he uses crutches or an electric Amigo scooter for mobility.\n\nPerlman first became interested in the violin after hearing a classical music performance on the radio. At the age of three, he was denied admission to the Shulamit Conservatory for being too small to hold a violin. He instead taught himself how to play the instrument using a toy fiddle until he was old enough to study with Rivka Goldgart at the Shulamit Conservatory and at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music), where he gave his first recital at age 10. He moved to the U.S. at age 13 to study at the Juilliard School with the violin teacher Ivan Galamian and his assistant Dorothy DeLay.\n\nPerlman appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show twice in 1958, and again in 1964, on the same show with the Rolling Stones. He made his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1963 and won the Leventritt Competition in 1964. Soon afterward, he began to tour widely. In addition to an extensive recording and performance career, he has continued to make appearances on television shows such as The Tonight Show and Sesame Street as well as playing at a number of White House functions.\n\nAlthough Perlman has never been billed or marketed as a singer, he sang the role of \"Un carceriere\" (\"a jailer\") on a 1981 EMI recording of Puccini's \"Tosca\" that featured Renata Scotto, Plácido Domingo, and Renato Bruson, with James Levine conducting. He had earlier sung the role in an excerpt from the opera on a 1980 Pension Fund Benefit Concert telecast as part of the Live from Lincoln Center series with Luciano Pavarotti as Cavaradossi and Zubin Mehta conducting the New York Philharmonic.\n\nOn July 5, 1986, Perlman performed at the New York Philharmonic's tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live on ABC. The orchestra, conducted by Mehta, performed in Central Park.\n\nIn 1987, Perlman joined the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) for its concerts in Warsaw and Budapest as well as other cities in Eastern bloc countries. He toured with the IPO in the spring of 1990 for its first-ever performance in the Soviet Union, with concerts in Moscow and Leningrad, and again in 1994, performing in China and India. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Itzhak Perlman\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.", new DateTime(1945, 8, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), null, 2, null, "nm0674221", "Acting", "Itzhak Perlman", new List<string>(), "Tel Aviv, Palestine [now Israel]", 5.4669999999999996, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\yELJweqEW6lzEIKlZJNQbEZprD8.jpg" },

Burns' works are treasure troves of archival materials; he skillfully utilizes period music and footage, photographs, periodicals and ordinary people's correspondence, the latter often movingly read by seasoned professional actors in a deliberate attempt to get away from a \"Great Man\" approach to history. Like most non-fiction filmmakers, Burns wears many hats on his projects, often serving as writer, cinematographer, editor and music director in addition to producing and directing. He achieved his apotheosis with The Civil War (1990), a phenomenally popular 11-hour documentary that won two Emmys and broke all previous ratings records for public TV. The series' companion coffee table book--priced at a hefty $50--sold more than 700,000 copies. The audio version, narrated by Burns, was also a major best-seller. In the final accounting, \"The Civil War\" became the first documentary to gross over $100 million. Not surprisingly, it has become perennial fund-raising programming for public TV stations around the country. Burns arrived upon the scene with the Oscar-nominated Brooklyn Bridge (1981), a nostalgic chronicle of the construction of the fabled edifice. The film was more widely seen when rebroadcast on PBS the following year. Though Burns has made other nonfiction films for theatrical release, notably an acclaimed and ambiguous portrait of Depression-era Louisiana governor Huey Long (1985), PBS would prove to be his true home. He cast a probing eye on such American subjects as The Statue of Liberty (1985), The Congress (1988) (PBS), painter Thomas Hart Benton (1988) (PBS) and early radio with Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio (1991) (PBS).

He made his drama debut in \"Good News\", which gained him immense popularity through his first full-time role as Naoya, playing the son of SMAP's Masahiro Nakai. In 2001, he was discovered by Hayao Miyazaki, and ended up voicing Bao in the animated film \"Spirited Away\" by Studio Ghibli, the highest-grossing Japanese film in Japan. From 1999 to 2002 he had appeared in over a dozen projects, earning him the title of a child prodigy. He was awarded his first award for \"Backdrop del mio Papá\" when he was only 11. From 2004 to 2020, he has won awards every one or two alternative years.\n\nToday, Ryu remains an iconic and beloved actor in the Japanese industry. He has the reputation of a reliable lead actor who goes into character as soon as the cameras start rolling. For his successful transition from a child actor to a main lead combined with his modest personality, has made him a role model for many. When choosing works, he likes to experiment with roles or plots. He does not mind too much about popularity or being the main lead as long as he likes his role. Rather than \"aiming for a big goal ahead\", he is the type to do the job in front of him wholeheartedly.\n\nHe has appeared in numerous award-winning projects. In 2011, he won his first international award for playing the main lead in the Amade Prize–winning \"Threads of Our Hearts\". To date, he has been an integral part of all the top 4 highest-grossing Japanese movies in Japan. His works continue to break records as his movie \"your name.\" became the highest-grossing Japanese movie of all time internationally.\n\nRyu, alongside acting and voice acting, has dabbled in multiple fields. For variety shows he often does many documentaries. He even interviewed Will Smith for the magazine TV program 'ZIP!'. In 2015, he released his first book \"Master's Café\". Ryu challenged his first stage play with \"Beautiful: The Woman Who Met with God\", directed and written by Suzuki Matsuo, in 2019. The following year, he debuted in multiple fields such as a radio DJ for 'All Night Nippon 0' (ANN0) on 11th October 2020, which airs 3 am at nights between Saturday and Sunday. His directorial debut was with the music video for \"I Treasure You\" for SUPER HANDSOME COLLECTION \"JUMP↑\". He opened his own YouTube channel. He was also the official photographer for Takeru Satoh's 2021 calendar.\n\nIn 2020, Ryu was awarded at the Elan d'or Award Ceremony, one of the most prestigious awards in Japan for completing 25 years in the industry.

His father, James, an educator, later married Veronica Gere, who raised him. An outstanding student, Gere graduated from Providence College in Rhode Island (1997), receiving a BA in Political Science and a Minor in Film Studies. Early on, David began modeling and working on both sides of the camera in films and commercials. Despite a European print campaign for GUESS Jeans (1997), David was more inspired by acting and filmmaking. He soon began a run of short films, documentaries, and music videos (MTV2) that were critically well-received. He developed a relationship with the emerging Rhode Island directors, Michael Corrente and Peter Farrelly, and got his first acting break in Outside Providence (1999), a film which Peter and his brother Bobby Farrelly produced and Corrente directed. In 2006, David appeared in Rocky Balboa, which he cites as a significant turning point, having been directed by his childhood hero, Sylvester Stallone. In 2007, David appeared on the CW Network's hit show Gossip Girl as Frank Meltzer. David is also an experienced stuntman, having performed stunts in The Dark Knight (2008) as one of Bane's Mercenaries. After working closely with professional wrestling legend Tommy Dreamer on the horror movie set of Army Of The Damned (2013), David began a career in the squared circle. Under Dreamer's guidance, Gere began performing as the villainous heel manager, DG Haven. The character has a cult level following, and is established in major promotions throughout North America. David is currently continuing his acting career, and is a producing partner for several major production companies including Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Media. Gere launched his new production company, Shadow Vale Productions in 2018. David Gere resides in Connecticut, where he owns several nightlife venues. David is also an accomplished abstract painter, his pieces have appeared in various films, and his work has been commissioned by celebrity peers.

After his parents divorce at the age of three, Ronan moved to New York with his mother, where he began his elementary school education. Through out this time Ronan spent most of his school holidays with his father back in Ireland, who was eager that Ronan hold on to his roots there. When Ronan Reached his early teens the situation was reversed, and he began going to school in Ireland and returning to the USA for his holidays. This bi-continental upbringing has given him a unique insight into both American and European ways of life, and has proved invaluable at various stages of his professional career. After school, Ronan was accepted in to the acting degree course at the prestigious Royal Welsh College Of Music And Drama, where he received a 2:1 and graduated in 2004. Next, He moved to London, where he has since worked consistently in the many varied aspects of the acting world, from Television to Feature Films, Shorts to Voice Overs, Performance Capture to Commercials, and both small and large scale theatre.

Richard is the oldest of 5, and had musician parents, Richard and Dorothy. The Rossi family performed in the bars of their hometown of Pittsburgh. As a teen, Richard acted in films such as 'The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh.'\n\nIn 1980, Richard formed a duo with his best friend from school, John Walker, and soon \"Walker and Rossi\" were performing their songs on TV. The Post Gazette compared them to Simon & Garfunkel and called them poets of song.  In 1984, Richard married his wife Sherrie in Lynchburg, Virginia. Sherrie saw Walker-Rossi perform at Liberty U., where they were given a standing ovation by the audience of 5,000. Richard & Sherrie moved back to Pgh. in 1986. Richard reached out to his hometown, performing concerts as a guitar-playing maverick minister at the nightclub Graffiti, Station Square, and Soldier's & Sailors.\n\nIn 1988, Richard and Sherrie became parents. Their daughter Karis was born. Richard was reading the Bible in the original Greek and came to a verse that read 'By grace ('Karis') are you saved.' In March of 1991, their second child, Joshua was born. Richard, Sherrie, Karis, and Joshua hosted dinners for the homeless and Richard hosted his talk-show 'Richard Rossi Live' during evening drive time on WPIT-FM until the station was sold in 1992. The popular program expanded to an international audience and now airs on BlogTalkRadio.\n\nRichard formed partnerships with African American ministers and founded the Multi-Cultural Community Coalition to combat racism. Richard's sermons were thespian, an art-form foretelling his future as an actor.\n\nIn 1996, Richard & family relocated, making a journey to Hollywood. Art became Richard's ministry. Richard took acting classes with another Pittsburgh native,Milton Katselas, and soon Richard was appearing on TV shows like Ally McBeal & Gilmore Girls.\n\nRichard was granted permission to perform the story of evangelist Elmer Gantry. Richard played the lead role & directed his version of the play at Stella Adler Theatre, garnering laudatory reviews. Richard's research revealed the Gantry play was inspired by faith healer Aimee Semple McPherson. This led to Richard's writing, directing, & acting in his films on Sister Aimee ('Saving Sister Aimee' and 'Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story' in 2008) that he made as an allegory for his former life as an evangelist. ABC called Richard the 'Pastor to the Stars' when it leaked out that he was advisor to stars.\n\nHe released 3 books: his 1st novel, 'Stick Man' a coming-of-age story, a self-help book entitled 'Create Your Life\" and his 3rd book 'Sister Aimee.' Musically, he released 3 albums 'Without Her Love,' 'Seasons of My Heart,' & 'The Kingdom Is Near.' He released his film on Roberto Clemente, 'Baseball's Last Hero,' & '10th Anniversary of Sister Aimee' a remastered collection of both of his films on Aimee McPherson.\n\nHis latest feature \"Canaan Land,\" stars Richard as an evangelist & co-stars Rebecca Holden as Sara Sunday, a female preacher.

She recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and had sung songs in over thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages, primarily in Marathi and Hindi. She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 12 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her in 1989 by the Government of India. She was also the second vocalist, after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to have ever been awarded the Bharat Ratna in 2001, India's highest civilian honor. She was the first Indian to perform in Royal Albert Hall in 1974. She was conferred France's highest civilian award (Officer of the Legion of Honour) in 2007. Due to all of her achievements, many singers and musicians consider her to be one of the greatest female singers in the Hindi film industry.

During his career, Scott has appeared in national ad campaigns for Miller Brewing Co., Matrix Hair Essentials, Fitness Quest, and has appeared in regional television spots for GNC, and The Art Institute.  In 1993, Scott won the role of “Glenn Quentin” in the 7 time Academy Award nominated motion picture, “The Shawshank Redemption”.  In 1995, Scott was voted to Cleveland Magazine's annual list of \"Most Interesting People\".\n\nWhile modeling in Cleveland and Chicago, Scott would also work as a photo assistant for local photographers. A developed interest to be behind the lens was now created.  Scott has been shooting a variety of media over the years.  One of his latest techniques is 'digitally painting' on his images, which has created some of his latest works.\n\nIn October of 2010, Scott was awarded the job to create 21 original 'digital paintings' for the Great Hall entrance to the new Cuyahoga County Juvenile Justice Center in Cleveland, Ohio.", null, null, 2, "http://scottmannphoto.com/", "nm0542957", "Acting", "Scott Mann", new List<string> { "Scott Mann (I)" }, null, 3.6469999999999998, "D:\\code\\projects\\CineVerse\\Data\\data\\images\\profiles\\sOqi4IDMyOo96eZhk15gqsxDitc.jpg" },

He was an autodidact with a great interest in painting. He moved to Rome at the age of 25 and entered the world of film through poster design. After creating the Italian posters for films like High Noon, he designed the title sequences to Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy — A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966). Often allowed an entirely free hand when designing titles and trailers, he worked from his study in Via Reno, Rome. He also designed the opening titles for Face to Face (1967), The Mercenary (1969), and Tepepa (1969).\n\nOutside of the Spaghetti Western genre, Lardani designed the openings for Casanova ’70 (1965), Il compagno Don Camillo (1965), Queimada (1969), and A Special Day (1977). Often affectionately referred to as “Gigi” and sometimes mistakenly called “Eugenio”, he also designed and edited film trailers, most notably those of Mogliamante (1977) by Marco Vicario and Una Gionata Particolare (1977) by Ettore Scola, which were awarded first and second place at Cannes in 1978.", new DateTime(1924, 12, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), new DateTime(1986, 5, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc), 2, null, null, "Art", "Igino Lardani", new List<string>(), "Áscoli Piceno, Italy", 0.55700000000000005, null },

At a young age he had already given many classical solo concerts. His desire to impro- vise soon brought him into contact with jazz. He became the youngest-ever member of Peter Herbolz- heimer’s Bundes-Jazz-Orchestra and the JORP.\n\nIn New York and in Boston Daniel trained under jazz greats Jeff Tain Watts and Alan Dawson. After two Masters degrees in Germany, one in jazz/pop performance at the University for Music and Art Mann- heim (2002), the other in film scoring at the University of Music and Theater Munich (2005), Daniel completed in 2009 the Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television Program (SMPTV) !at the University of Southern California. His studies there have put him in both academic and professional contact with ma- jor players in the film and film music industry.\n\nAs jazz and classical instrumentalist as well as conductor, Daniel toured South America, the Middle East, Europe and the US. In addition to his compositions for film and games, Wehr enjoys a successful career as arranger and producer in the field of pop and dance.\n\nIn 2000 Daniel worked for the Communication Research Center Fabrica Musica in Italy, where he was brought together with Michael Nyman as well as Ennio Morricone and conceptualized music and sound design to Peter Gabriel’s Witness campaign. With The Left Hand Of Glenn Gould, the experimental mul- timedia theater piece directed by Grammy nominated Heiner Goebbels, he gave guest performances in London, in Germany and at the Taormina Festival in Italy.\n\nIn 2005 Daniel founded Collage: Cinetronic Music Art. Collage is a creative multimedia-platform, on which contemporary artists can present their works and ideas in a not-yet-experienced environment. Collage unites numerous art forms, cultures and people from all over the world.\n\nSince 2009 Daniel lives in Munich, Germany and Los Angeles, USA, where he works as composer, orches- trator and instrumentalist. He was involved in several international Hollywood productions .\n\nIn Europe he is best known for his music to the TV hit series Pastewka (Sat1), the comedy No Mercy and as a session musician for Frank Griebe/ Franka Potente.\n\nNext to film and commercial music Daniel has never lost sight of his concert music and stage perform- ances. In 2009 he composed and conducted the commissioned concert work Thalamus in Carnegie Hall. Daniel Wehr is invited to give lectures and workshops at universities in Europe and the USA.", null, null, 2, null, "nm1988193", "Sound", "Daniel Wehr", new List<string>(), "Koblenz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany", 1.5509999999999999, null },
